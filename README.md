libinput
========

libinput is a library that provides a full input stack for display servers
and other applications that need to handle input devices provided by the
kernel.

libinput provides device detection, event handling and abstraction so
minimize the amount of custom input code the user of libinput need to
provide the common set of functionality that users expect. Input event
processing includes scaling touch coordinates, generating
relative pointer events from touchpads, pointer acceleration, etc.

User documentation
------------------

Documentation explaining features available in libinput is available
[here](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/pages.html).

This includes the [FAQ](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/faq.html)
and the instructions on
[reporting bugs](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/reporting_bugs.html).


Architecture
------------

libinput is not used directly by applications. Think of it more as a device
driver than an application library. It is used by the xf86-input-libinput
X.Org driver or Wayland compositors. The typical software stack for a system
running Wayland is:

@dotfile libinput-stack-wayland.gv

The Wayland compositor may be Weston, mutter, KWin, etc. Note that
Wayland encourages the use of toolkits, so the Wayland client (your
application) does not usually talk directly to the compositor but rather
employs a toolkit (e.g. GTK) to do so. The Wayland client does not know
whether libinput is in use.

The simplified software stack for a system running X.Org is:

@dotfile libinput-stack-xorg.gv

libinput is not employed directly by the X server but by the
xf86-input-libinput driver instead. That driver is loaded by the server
on demand, depending on the xorg.conf.d configuration snippets. The X client
does not know whether libinput is in use.

Examples of how to use libinput are the debugging tools in the libinput
repository. Developers are encouraged to look at those tools for a
real-world (yet simple) example on how to use libinput.
