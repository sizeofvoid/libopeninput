/**
 * Inject a new event frame from the given plugin. This
 * frame is treated as if it was just sent by the kernel's
 * event node and is processed immediately, interrupting
 * any other processing from this device.
 *
 * This function can be called any time but unlike
 * libinput_plugin_append_evdev_frame() and
 * libinput_plugin_prepend_evdev_frame() it starts
 * processing the frame at the bottom of the plugin
 * stack.
 *
 * The injected event will also be sent to
 * the current plugin, a guard needs to be in
 * place to prevent recursion.
 *
 * Injecting events may cause other plugins to
 * behave unexpectedly (see below). In almost all cases
 * it is better to use libinput_plugin_append_evdev_frame()
 * or libinput_plugin_prepend_evdev_frame() to only
 * affect the plugins logically *after* this
 * plugin.
 *
 * Assuming several plugins P1, P2, and P3 and
 * an event frame E, and P2 calling this function
 * with an injected event I:
 * - P1: receives E, optionally modifies E
 * - P2: receives E, injects I
 *   - P1: receives I, optionally modifies I
 *   - P2: receives I, optionally modifies I
 *   - P3: receives I, optionally modifies I
 * - P2: continues processing E, optionally modifies E
 * - P3: receives E, optionally modifies E
 *
 * For P1 the injected event I is received after E,
 * for P3 the injected event I is received before E.
 *
 * An example for event injection being harmful:
 * A plugin may monitor tablet proximity state and prepent
 * proximity-in events if the tablet does not send proximity-in
 * events. This plugin stops monitoring events once it sees correct
 * proximity-in events.
 * If another plugin were to inject a proximity event (e.g. to fake a
 * different tool coming into proximity), the plugin would stop
 * monitoring. Future proximity events from the tablet will then
 * have the wrong proximity.
 * This can be avoided by appending or prepending the events instead
 * of injecting them.

/**
 * Queue an event frame for the next plugin in sequence, after
 * the current event frame being processed.
 *
 * This function can only be called from within the evdev_frame()
 * callback or within a plugin's timer func and may be used to
 * queue new frames. If called multiple times with frames F1, F2, ...
 * while processing the current frame C, frame sequence to be passed
 * to the next plugin is C, F1, F2, ...
 *
 * Assuming several plugins P1, P2, P3, and P4 and an event frame E,
 * and P2 and P3 calling this function with an queued event frame Q1 and Q2,
 * respectively.
 *
 * - P1: receives E, optionally modifies E
 * - P2: receives E, appends Q1, optionally modifies E
 * - P3: receives E, appends Q2, optionally modifies E
 * - P3: receives Q1, optionally modifies Q1
 * - P4: receives E, optionally modifies E
 * - P4: receives Q2, optionally modifies Q2
 * - P4: receives Q1, optionally modifies Q1
 *
 * Once plugin processing is complete, the event sequence passed
 * back to libinput is thus [E, Q2, Q1].
 *
 * To discard the original event frame, the plugin needs to
 * call evdev_frame_reset() on the frame passed to it.
 *
 * It is a plugin bug to call this function from outside the
 * evdev_frame() callback or a timer callback.
 *
 * If called within a plugin's timer callback, any frames generated by
 * the plugin will only be seen by plugins after this plugin. These
 * frames will be processed in the usual evdev_fame() callback and there
 * is no indication that the events were queued from within a timer
 * callback. Using the above example:
 *
 * - P1: <idle>
 * - P2: timer callback invoked, appends Q1
 * - P3: receives Q1, appends Q2, optionally modifies Q1
 * - P4: receives Q2, optionally modifies Q2
 * - P4: receives Q1, optionally modifies Q1
 *
 * Because there is no current frame during a timer callback
 * libinput_plugin_append_evdev_frame() and
 * libinput_plugin_prepend_evdev_frame() are functionally equivalent.
 * If both functions are used, all events from
 * libinput_plugin_prepend_evdev_frame() will be queued before
 * events from libinput_plugin_append_evdev_frame().
